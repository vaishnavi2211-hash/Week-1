PROBLEM STATEMENT:

"Illegal sand mining" is increasing in many regions and causing severe environmental damage such as riverbank erosion, loss of aquatic biodiversity, reduced groundwater levels, and land degradation.
However, identifying sand-mining activities manually from images is time-consuming and often inaccurate.
To solve this, my project focuses on using Image Classification to automatically detect whether a given image contains sand mining activity or not. This helps contribute to sustainable resource management and supports SDG Goal 15 – Life on Land.

WHY I CHOOSE THIS PROBLEM ?:
Sand is the second most consumed natural resource after water
Illegal extraction increases every year
Many governments struggle to monitor mining areas

DATASET USED:
Roboflow Sand Mining Dataset (public)

DATASET CONTAINS:
Sand mining images
Non-mining river images
Labeled categories for training a classifier
