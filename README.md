1. Problem Statement

Illegal sand mining causes riverbank erosion, water level reduction, habitat loss, and environmental imbalance.
Manual monitoring is difficult because sand mining often happens in remote or hidden river areas.
Therefore, I selected the project “AI-Based Sand Mining Detection Using Image Classification” to identify sand-mining activity from river images.

2. Reason for Choosing This Problem

Environmental sustainability ki direct impact
SDG 14 (Life Below Water) & SDG 15 (Life on Land) support chestundi
Government & environmental agencies ki useful
Real-time monitoring improve cheyadaniki AI help chestundi
Unique + socially relevant topic

3. Dataset Used (Week-1)

I chose a dataset containing:
✅ Sand mining images
✅ Normal river images
✅ Labeled categories (Mining / Non-Mining)
✅ Export formats → YOLO / CSV / JSON
Dataset Source: Roboflow (Searched using “Sand Mining Dataset”, “River Mining”, “Illegal Mining Detection”)

4. Technologies Planned

Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch
YOLOv8 Classification
Google Colab
OpenCV
Roboflow Dataset Tools

5. Expected Output

A model that identifies whether an image shows Sand Mining or Non-Mining
Accuracy & Loss graphs
Predictions on sample river images2. Updated Dataset Explanation
